    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, 
            salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, 
            whisk together the milk and egg.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
             Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry 
             ingredients until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
            Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
